# Data-Analysis-Project-2025
  This project aims to predict heart disease using logistic regression and decision trees trained on clinical attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, quantum pattern features, and heart disease. By leveraging classification algorithms, I assess the likelihood of heart disease based on patterns within patient data. The core objective is to determine which learning model performs best in predicting heart disease and to evaluate key features that influence the prediction. I will compare the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and the AUC.

  Results: After comparing the results of the classification algorithms. The logistic regression model seemed to perform better than the decision tree. Logistic regression had a higher accuracy of 94%, higher precision of 98.2%, F-1 score of 94.8%, indicating it was more effective in making correct predictions. While both models had a similar recall of 91.7% meaning they identified heart disease cases equally well. The confusion matrix further supports that logistic regression had fewer misclassifications.

  Furthermore, if this model were deployed in a hospital setting, I would recommend prioritizing precision and recall minimizing false diagnoses and ensure that high-risk patients are accurately flagged for further evaluation. Since logistic regression performed slightly better in terms of precision and overall stability, it might be preferred model. However, decision tree provides better interpretability, making it easier for medical professionals to understand which features contribute most to heart disease prediction. False negatives in the confusion matrix can be dangerous in a hospital setting, meaning patients at risk of heart disease should not be mistakenly classified as healthy. A better approach would be to use a random forest method which could improve reliability.
